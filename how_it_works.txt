How it works

We used concepts from Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to implement the sophisticated network
that you see displayed on the main page of this website.  This visual network is known as a "Hopfield" meaning
that each node is conncected to every other node, and the lines between the nodes, called "edges" have "weights" that
