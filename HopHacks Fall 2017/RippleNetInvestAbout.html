      <h1 class="rDeepBlue">Our Mission</h1>
      <p class="rDeepBlue"><b>Money makes the world go round. But what happens when there isn't enough money to go around? There are impoverished areas all across the globe, full of people struggling just to feed their families. The goal of RippleNet Charity is to fix poverty using artificial intelligence. Using advanced analytic techniques coupled with machine learning and AI, our software is capable of analyzing financial trends and can determine which charities could influence others and spread the most good. Our idea is simple: everything in the world is connected, and those connections can be used to spread aid across the world.  Imagine knowing that donating to help Kenya could improve quality of life in India, or that supporting the impoverished in the United States could help create jobs in Venezula.  Things that would be impossible to predict could suddenly be just a click away.  Using RippleNet, you can make your donation count for more than face value and watch good spread throughout the world.<br /><br />Every penny counts, and our algorithms figure out how to make it count the most.</b></p>

      <h1 class="rDeepBlue">Our Team</h1>
      <p class="rDeepBlue"><br /><b>RippleNet was a team project, and there were many people who made it happen:</b><br /><br /><b>Devin Ãœner</b> is a softmore majoring in Computer Engineering at Iowa State University. He is interested in automation, artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. Devin handled creating the AI and helped create algorithms for both front and back end.<br /><b>Eric Cochran</b> is currently a sophomore at Johns Hopkins University who is studying Mathematics and Computer Science.   He primarily worked on developing a JavaScript implementation of the Hopfield as well as the visual presentation of the network that one can find on the front page of the site.<br /><b>Kevin Quach</b> is a data scientist and a Masters student at Johns Hopkins University studying Applied Mathematics. He scraped for financial stock data using R, set up the AWS environment, and developed the logo of RippleNet.<br /><b>Stephen Kyranakis</b> is a freshman student of Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.  He studied computer science for two years in high school.  Stephen built most of the front-end.</p>
